## Course Description
This course ventures into the world of vectors, linear independence, scalar product, matrices, simultaneous equations, determinants, vector product, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and their applications. It further explores the equation of a straight line & plane, extreme value theorem, maxima & minima, sequences, series, Taylor series, L'Hopital's rules, techniques of integration, numerical methods, and volumes of revolution.

## Assumed Background
We expect students to have a fundamental understanding of Algebra and Calculus, and be familiar with vectors, complex numbers, and 2x2 matrices and their inverses.

## Introduction
MATH1051 provides an indispensable foundation in calculus and linear algebra. The calculus component investigates optimisation techniques, limits, L'Hopital's rule, standard techniques of integration, volumes of revolution, sequences and series, and Taylor series.

Linear algebra component involves the study of vectors and matrices, with extensive applications in various fields such as structural engineering and computer graphics. The course encompasses vectors, linear independence, scalar product, matrices, simultaneous equations, determinants, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and more.

Additionally, the course offers an introduction to MATLAB, a computational mathematics package widely used in real-life applications and further studies in engineering and scientific computation.
